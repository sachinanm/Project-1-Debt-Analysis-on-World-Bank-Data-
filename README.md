# Project: 
The Data used for below analysis has been provided by The World Bank.

Exploring and analyzing international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories (debt indicators) w.r.t the year 2020.

### 8.	The most common debt indicator(https://github.com/sachinanm/Project-1-Debt-Analysis-on-World-Bank-Data-/blob/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)
### 9.	Other viable debt issues and conclusion(https://github.com/sachinanm/Project-1-Debt-Analysis-on-World-Bank-Data-/blob/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis.ipynb)




# Conclusion
Few deductions from analysis:
120 countries have taken loan from the world bank across 141 debt indicators which amounts to 12.48 trillion US dollars.
China has taken the most amount of loan (1520 billion US dollars) from the world bank and a large chunk of its loan is under debt service on external debt, long term(TDS, current US$).
There are a total of 27 debt indicators in which all the countries listed in our dataset have taken debt. This indicates that all these countries are suffering from some common economic issues.
